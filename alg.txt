Define feed handler packets


Primary Thread
	sets up other threads, then handles incoming packets

	On startup
		create feed handler channel
		launch feed handler thread
		accept packets via while let .next().await (FH thread)

	On packet
		filter valid packet (framed handles this)
		send packet enum to feed handler channel

FeedHandler thread
	handles primary IO resources and actual feeding process

	On feed handler packet
		wait for ir off
		motor on
		delay until sw on
		delay until sw off
		motor off
